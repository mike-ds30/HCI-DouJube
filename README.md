# HCI-DouJube

DouJube is given as a quiz case for the Human and Computer Interaction Course. This is a simple website made using HTML and CSS, made within 100 minutes to demonstrate the various capabilities of CSS in designing a website, containing two pages, a home page containing information on DouJube, and a membership page showcasing HTML's capabilities in creating forms. This website also demonstrates fast thinking skills by limiting the time spent creating it.
